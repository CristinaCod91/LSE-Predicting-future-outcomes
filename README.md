Turtle Games is a game manufacturer and retailer with a global customer base. The company manufactures and sells its own products, along with sourcing and selling products manufactured by other companies. Its product range includes books, board games, video games, and toys. The company collects data from sales as well as customer reviews. Turtle Games has a business objective of improving overall sales performance by utilising customer trends. 

To improve overall sales performance, Turtle Games has come up with an initial set of questions:

•	how customers accumulate loyalty points

•	how groups within the customer base can be used to target specific market segments 

•	how social data (e.g. customer reviews) can be used to inform marketing campaigns the impact that each product has on sales

•	how reliable the data is (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis)

•	what the relationship(s) is/are (if any) between North American, European, and global sales.
